To initiate CustomManualSelectorGenerator setup simply set the config to register an unused animation Id. 
When first adding a new weapon art CMSG, make sure to register the no FP variant after the regular anim.
e.g.: 
360000
360001

You will be prompted to set up a new CMSG and to provide the following parameters (for any input that provides a default value simply press enter to use it):

Name: This is the name used in hks with the prefix "W_" to trigger the animation (e.g. "AttackRightLight1" will be referred to as "W_AttackRightLight1" in hks)

Animation Hand: Enter "right" or "r" for right handed attacks, "left" or "l" for left handed attacks and "both" or "b" for 2 handed attacks.
				Determines which state machine the CMSG will be registered under, also determines offsetType.

Transition Name: The default transition is #292, if a different one is necessary enter the ID or name of the desired hkbBlendingTransitionEffect or CustomTransitionEffect. 

generatorChangedTransitionEffect: Null by default, if a different one is necessary enter the ID or name of the desired hkbBlendingTransitionEffect or CustomTransitionEffect. 

Weapon Art: If you wish to register weapon art animations, choose yes. This option will set up an hkManualSelectorGenerator and two CMSGs 
			and is also useful for setting up any animations that use the same name in hks and choose CMSG based on a variable set in hks. 
			This is currently limited to two CMSGs per hkManualSelectorGenerator however.
			
Variable Name: This is the variable that will be used to determine whether to play the regular or no FP version of the weapon art animation. 
			   By default this is "IsEnoughArtPointsL2" which is used for weapon art starter attacks. For weapon art followup attacks see the "SetSwordArtsPointInfo" function in hks.
			   Adding variables is currently not supported.


 After setting up a CMSG, further animations can be registered to it as usual.
